A python document analysing a data set that containing information about 2833 music albums. Data set also contains the album covers of the music albums.

The document is split into two parts. 

The first part is prediciting the popularity of the music albums using the tabular data in the data set.
This is done using four different machine learning models; KNN, Random forest, SVM and Linear regression. 

The second part is a CNN built using Keras. This CNN takes inn the images of the album covers, and uses this data to predict the popularity of the music albums.
